Description: an easy way to assign newly created macro to a key
 Emacs has standard macro record key C-x '(' and macro end key C-x ')'
 but's recording several macros and playing them from keys has been
 missing.
 .
 This package contains a helper function that can be bound to the C-x
 ')' key. Ater user has recorded the action, it is saved to a
 temporary function and user can select a key from which the macro can
 be recalled. E.g. if you kill some line, replace another text ... you
 can assign the action to a some free F-key.
 .
 Several macros can be bound to different keys to make it possible to
 combine and repeat complex text manipulation actions in a buffer.
